Introduction

============



\*Scalpers, ticket touts, black market sellers, and secondary ticketers\*

are all terms used to describe people and organizations that profit from

the reselling of tickets without adding any value to the industry. In

many countries, primary ticketing organizations and other stakeholders

have attempted to restrict the secondary market, but these initiatives

offer little protection to the consumer. Though secondary ticketing

organizations facilitate a free market and match high ticket demands

with similar offers, resellers are denounced by fans and artists alike,

who criticize resellers for deceptive tactics and exorbitant price

hikes. Blockchain based tickets are a solution to this problem and

various other issues the ticketing industry faces. GUTS Tickets, an

operational smart ticketing company, has pioneered such a solution. By

offering an blockchain protocol, that can be used as a back-bone

API/protocol for ticketing companies, the GET Foundation will drive this

effort to revolutionize the ticketing sector and create an industry wide

paradigm shift that will result in completely honest and transparent

ticketing value streams for all actors.



\#\#\#\#\# Artificial Scarcity and Fraud



Professional resellers create unnecessary scarcity in the

ticket-acquisition process, creating confusion about the price and

availability of tickets. Their intrusion into the process imposes a

burden on fans and threatens artists’ revenue from live performances:

events which are becoming increasingly crucial to artists’ success.

Instances of ticket fraud compound these problems, as many fans are

denied access to events because they were sold an invalid, fake, or

already scanned ticket.



Non transparent and profitable market

-------------------------------------



The difference in demand and price between the moment a ticket goes on

sale and the time that the event begins creates a lucrative arbitrage

opportunity for middlemen resellers, whether they are individuals, bots,

or companies. This arbitrage opportunity results in two distinct ticket

markets:



\#\#\#\#\# 1. The primary ticket market



Event organizers or content creators \(i.e. artists\) issue original

tickets on the primary market, at a price that they set themselves.

Event organizers then engage ticketing companies to sell and distribute

the tickets for the event, and the ticketing company typically charges

transaction and administration costs in addition to the original ticket

price. In some cases, these added costs are distributed between the

event organizer and the ticketing company without the consumer knowing.



\#\#\#\#\# 2. The secondary ticket market



Thirty percent of all tickets are sold through the secondary market. The

ticket resellers that belong to this market, such as touts and scalpers,

acquire quantities of the original tickets with the intention of selling

them at a much higher price. Ticket touts advertise ticket sales for

upcoming events before the primary market even issues the tickets and,

in some cases, touts make a deal with primary ticketing companies to

acquire a certain number of original tickets before they are available

for purchase by fans.



\#\#\#\#\# Falsifying event tickets



The most objectionable type of secondary ticketing practice is fraud.

The authenticity of a ticket is determined by ink printed onto a piece

of paper or through an image in a PDF file, a “technology” that makes

committing ticket fraud as easy as taking a screen shot or operating a

copier.



\#\#\#\#\# The secondary ticket market in numbers



In 2009, Europe Economics undertook a study to gain a better

understanding of the structure and scale of the secondary ticketing

market.



-   For popular music festivals, 20-30% of tickets are resold at a

    mark-up of 30%



-   For high-end events \(e.g. Kings of Leon\), 20-40% of tickets are

    resold at a mark-up of 100-250



-   For very high-end events \(e.g. Madonna\), 60-70% of tickets are

    resold, often with a mark-up exceeding 500%.



The ticket life cycle and middlemen

-----------------------------------



Assessing the life cycle of a ticket for a popular event reveals a vast

number of intermediaries between the content creator and the end user.

Several of these intermediaries – the promoters, the bookers, the

artists’ management, the venues themselves, and the primary ticketing

companies – add certain value to the chain. The fragmentation of all

these intermediaries, however, prevents transparency and results in two

problems: the commercial ticket reseller and dishonest transaction

costs. A transparent market avoids these issues and provides end users

with a fair and straightforward ticket purchasing experience.



\#\#\#\#\# Consequences for the stakeholders



In addition to the unnecessary burdens they impose on fans, middlemen

can also create problems for event organizers and content creators,

including low ticket sales and an inability to attract the right

audience. Exorbitant ticket prices often provoke conflict between

unhappy fans and content creators, who are themselves incapable of

controlling prices set by secondary market resellers. Other stakeholders

rarely share user data with the content creators, with the risk that the

latter lose a critical opportunity to cultivate a sustainable fan base.

Despite adding very little value to the event itself, intermediaries

earn more than the content creators. Event organizers bear all of the

financial risks, yet they have little or no control over ticket sales

because they have no alternative than to enlist a ticketing company to

issue tickets. By relinquishing the control of ticket sales to a third

party, content creators and event organizers are, at their own expense,

providing opportunities to intermediaries who benefit in the short-term

without contributing to the artists’ future success, making the

promotion of upcoming events more difficult and allowing the events

themselves to remain a large financial risk for organizers.



\#\#\# The right to resell the ticket



A purchased ticket is the property of the end user, and users have the

fundamental right to \(re\)sell their property. Regulating ticket

reselling, however, is complicated, and current solutions remain

inadequate. In the Netherlands, for example, a law to end extreme prices

for secondary tickets remains under review six years after it was first

proposed. Governments will not provide a global solution for the

problem, let alone a local one. The rise of online markets has eroded

the government’s power to regulate, even when the laws are in place.\

Modern ticketing companies mainly use barcodes or QR codes to store all

of the ticket data required for event admission. These data types merely

obfuscate a ticket holder’s information, which is later checked against

a database prior to entry. Information is only encoded, not encrypted,

and therefore can be scanned and decoded by anyone with a smart phone.

These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for malicious actors to

modify these data structures and create a new barcode that will be

unique but not recognized as legitimate when consumers try to use them

to enter an event.\

The scarcity of event tickets combined with the unregulated nature of

the market ensures that resellers will always exploit end users with

exorbitant secondary tickets prices. It is common knowledge that certain

primary ticketing companies and secondary ticketing companies are

subsidiaries of the same holding companies, which illustrate how market

forces incentivize revenue maximization to the detriment of content

creators and fans alike.\

\#\#\# The GET Protocol Solution



A solution to the issues posed by the secondary market should address

the root cause of the problem: the ability to resell tickets at a higher

price by charging additional and unnecessary fees. The solution proposed

in this white paper—the \*\*G\*\*auranteed \*\*E\*\*ntrance \*\*T\*\*oken \(GET\)

protocol—does just that.
